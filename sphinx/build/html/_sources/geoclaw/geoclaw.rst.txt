Shallow water solvers
=======================

There are several shallow water solvers available. In this work, we have focused on two of the primary ones of interest to the community: GeoClaw and AdCirc.

GeoClaw
-----------

GeoClaw is a part of Clawpacky that was originally developed in 1994 by Prof. Randall LeVeque and co-workers. More information can be found on the website of `Clawpack <https://www.clawpack.org>`_. It is used quite often for tsunami modeling.

In this documentation, we will discuss aspects of particular importance to the Hydro-UQ platform that includes the format of the GeoClaw files.

AdCirc 
--------

AdCirc is often used for modeling storm surges.

SimCenter formats

Development of file standards can help in the sustainable growth of community projects. SimCenter proposes the below formats for storing information related to the shallow water solvers.
