Creating Workflows
**********************

In the |app|, users may create a custom workflow to perform regional loss assessment for earthquake, wind, and storm surge hazards at varying levels of fidelity. Components of the workflow must be chosen to match a user's particular hazard type and available data on the hazard. 

For a guide on preparing a workflow, refer to the following pages:
