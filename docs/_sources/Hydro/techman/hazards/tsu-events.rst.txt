Tsunami events
========================

The major areas of the world that experience strong activity with potential for tsunami are along the boundaries of the Pacific ocean with other regions. However, in general, tsunamis can be generated in any coastal area, including inland seas and large lakes. :numref:`TsunamiWorld`, sourced from NOAA, maps some of the trunami-prone regions in the world.

There are good records for recent tsunamis. However, for those in the past centuries, these are mostly based on the accounts of personal observations. :numref:`TsunamiEvents` shows the tsunami events caused due to earthquakes/volcanic eruptions/landslides/other causes between 1610 B.C. to 2017 A.D. The events are classified based on magnitude and cause by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The tabular data shown in :numref:`TsunamiRegion`, compiled by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) under the UNESCO/IOC-NOAA partnership, provides a glossery of tsunami events over the last 2000 years. Tsunamis that have a travel time of 1-3 hours are classified as regional tsunamis and major ones over the last 2000 years are shown in :numref:`TsunamiRegion`.

The destruction caused by a tsunami can range to much larger extents. The tsunami that cause damage in regions beyond three hour of travel are classified as distant/teletsunami. Some of these from the last 300 years are shown in :numref:`TsunamiDistant`
