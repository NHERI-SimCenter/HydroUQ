Water-borne Natural Hazards
================================

Tsunami
-----------

The term *tsunami* is derived from two Japanese words, namely "tsu" (meaning harbor) and "nami" (meaning wave). Some of the original literature described them as tidal waves or seismic sea waves. Tsunamis are usually created by disturbances in the crust of the Earth. The resulting uplifting of the water surface over a large area forms a train of the long-period waves. These waves generated from tsunamis have huge wavelengths. In contrast to wind-generated waves, where the periods are about one minute, the periods are of the order of one hour and more. 

Once generated, these tsunami waves travel across the ocean basin to cause great destruction at locations far from the source. Owing to their destructive nature, it is imporant to comprehend the mechanisms of their generation, propagation and predict the extent of flooding/effect of wave forces in the coastal areas that are potential to tsunamis. In these areas susceptible to tsunamis, it is imperative to build resilient structures and communities.

Storm Surge
---------------

Storm surge can be defined as the abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tides. During a storm surge the water level rises due to the presence of a storm. There is no reference level in this regard. As shown in :numref:`surgeevent` is different from a storm tide which implies a rise in water level during a storm due to the combination of storm surge and astronomical tide. A reference level is defined for a storm tide.
