This is the tool for studying Water-borne Hazards Engineering with Uncertainty Quantification (Hydro-UQ) application.
</h1>
<p>
This open-source research application, https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/Hydro-UQ, provides a critical aspect of the research simulation tools and workflow aimed at predicting the response of coastal communities prone to water-borne natural hazard events. In particular, the tool aims to provide an open-source and inter-changeable modular framework for modeling of tsunami and storm surge events.
<p>
Today, researchers in the areas of tsunami and storm-surge event modeling rely on shallow-water solvers. While shallow-water solver are extremely fast, they do not allow accurate determination of the building response due to wave loading. Alternatively, high-fidelity three-dimensional CFD simulations are computationally prohibitive for simulation of communities beyond a few buildings. Even with commercial CFD solvers, the geometries of building/bridges that can be modeled is significantly limited. Thus, there is a need for a more coupled solution.
<p>
Hydro-UQ (alpha) brings about a coupled modular workflow that interfaces 2-D shallow water solvers with three-dimensional CFD solvers. The tool allows users to bring in existing two-dimensional shallow-water solutions and resolve areas of interest using three-dimensional CFD. Alternatively, SimCenter also provides a shallow-water library from where one can choose from a set of pre-computed solutions. The tool automatically calculates and sets up the boundary conditions at the shallow-water-to-CFD interface. Besides, the users can also add buildings and floating bodies to study the flow fields around them. At present, the tool supports input of data (input/output) from GeoClaw shallow-water solver and support for AdCirc as planned in the future releases. However, owing to the modular nature of the workflow, other solvers can be easily interfaced with. A unique feature of the tool is its ability to model wave flume experiments particularly. Most tsunami/storm-surge tests are conducted in wave flume (like the Oregon wave flume). The tool facilitates direct usage of parameters from the wave flume for simulations. The tool is generic enough to enable simulation using any STL / OBJ CAD files. In the upcoming release, it is also planned to have bathymetry selection using maps.
<p>
Such computations can be prohibitively expensive to perform on a user's local computer. The user can quickly set up the calculations remotely on the Stampede2 supercomputer using Agave APIs. Stampede2 is located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and made available to the user through NHERI DesignSafe, the cyberinfrastructure provider for the distributed NSF funded Natural Hazards in Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) facility.
<p>
The design of the Hydro-UQ application is such that researchers are able to modify the backend application to utilize their own application in the workflow computations. This will ensure researchers are not limited to using the default applications we provide and will be enthused to provide their own applications for others to use.
<p>
This is Version 1.0.0 of the tool and as such is limited in scope. Researchers are encouraged to comment on what additional features and applications they would like to see in this application. If you want it, chances are many of your colleagues also would benefit from it.
